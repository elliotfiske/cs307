1.3.  Operational Setting
</h3>
</a>
<p>
Test Tool will have 2 operational settings: (1) The software system being used by the teacher or proctor who creates and gives exams; (2) The software system being used by the student to take an exam.
<br><br>
Test Tool will be designed for private use within a classroom setting at a college or university. The software should be installed on all computers in the participating classes and students and teachers will both need accounts to access the software.
<br><br>
Depending on the class Test Tool is to be used in and the operating system is it to be installed on, different set up instructions may need to be followed.
<br><br>
The Test Tool software is also to be used as method to practice Software Engineering during Prof. Fisherâ€™s CPE 307 course.
