<p>

When creating hand written tests, instructors face tedious challenges, such as:
<ol type=a>
<li>finding questions to re-use from previous exams</li><br>
<li>grading each exam by hand</li><br>
<li>wasting resources through paper-based exams</li><br>
<li>preventing cheating by making multiple test versions</li><br>
</ol>
The Test Tool provides an interface for a non-technical instructor to customize and generate assessments for their
classes. The tool provides useful features to address these challenges, such as:

<ol type=a>
<li><strong>Generating New Exams:</strong> stores questions based on topic to easily generate new tests on the same
material without printing several versions</li><br>
<li><strong>Preventing Cheating:</strong> randomizes the order of questions and can compare written answers to check for plagiarism
against old responses</li><br>
<li><strong>Sharing Questions Safely:</strong> allows all members of a department to share a database of questions
without a paper-trail</li><br>
<li><strong>Multiple Tries:</strong> lets the instructor set how many times a question can be answered and gives
immediate feedback to students</li><br>
<li><strong>Grading and Visualizing Data: </strong>provides automatic grading, immediate feedback, and graphs/statistics about questions
so instructors can identify where their students are struggling</li><br>
</ol>
The Test Tool is being developed to meet the needs of a particular customer. Several of the customer's desired features,
such as the ones above, are not available in any existing tools that we know of.
