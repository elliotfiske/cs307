1.5.4  ClassMarker Review
</strong>
</a>
<p>
<font> <p>ClassMarker is a highly developed tool for giving tests.  ClassMarker has question
 banks, easy test distribution, and automatic grading.  The web-based snd therefore incredibly 
 versatile as it can work across any device and in a variety of environments.
   However it is lacking one of the most crucial features of test tool - code based questions.</p>

<p>Overall ClassMarker actually has a fantastic set of features for test takers, but it's
 general use design makes it lack the necessary features for a code based exam.</p>
 
 <p>
  <strong> Good Features </strong>
   <ul>
   <li> Test Banks </li>
   <li> Auto Grading </li>
   <li> Ability to distribute test publicly and privately </li>
   <li> A variety of test formats </li>
   <li> Question randomizations </li>
   <li> Fairly nice GUI based question creation </li>
   </ul> </p>
   
   <p>
<strong>   Bad Features </strong>
   <ul>
   <li> Question importing is only specific to their format </li>
   <li> Test randomization doesnâ€™t generate a test, rather gives every student a different test with the same
   types of questions with each test being different </li>
   <li> Seems to be made with businesses in mind and as such has  many unnecessary features </li>
   </ul> </p></font>
   
  <p>
<strong>   Missing Features </strong>
   <ul>
   <li> Test generation (as opposed to just randomization) </li>
   <li> Support for coding based questions </li>
   <li> Sharing questions between departments </li>
   <li> Any sort of difficulty ratings </li>
   </ul> </p>
