1.5.6 quizgen
</h4>
</a>
<p>

An open source test generation tool, quizgen, allows instructors to create assessments and then make them availble to
students in html format for self-assessment purposes. Since the output is in html, this tool is ideal for generating
tests that are compatible with all platforms. Unfortunately, due to the web-based output, the tool lacks functionality
essential to our customer's needs. The student opens the html file and clicks on the answers to the questions, to which
the document displays whether the student answered correctly.
<p>
<strong>Good Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>its web-based tests are compatible with any device that has an internet connection</li>
<li>supports all the basic question types and has syntax-highlighting for code</li>
<li>supports special formatting and LateX</li>
<li>supports embedding images/media into the tests</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Bad Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>this tool only generates self-asessements, which is not ideal for exams</li>
<li>generating the tests is very complex and requires editing a text file</li>
<li>the generated tests are static and cannot be randomized to prevent cheating</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Missing Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>no test bank (very critical, a test generation tool is practically useless if the instructor has to create each test
by hand) </li>
<li>does not report scores back to the instructor</li>
<li>no GUI for fast test generation</li>
<li>cannot adjust point values</li>
<li>does not allow students to have multiple tries</li>
<li>does not prevent unauthorized users from accessing the test</li>
<li>no time constraints</li>
</ul>
