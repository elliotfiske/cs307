2.3.  Creating a Course, Sections, and Question Types
</h3>
</a>
<p>
This scenario shows an individual instructor creating a new course, which serves as
a collection of question types for the instructor to select from when creating a test.
We assume that the instructor is using the Test Tool from scratch besides creating an account
and logging in, which is detailed in Section 1.

The initial Courses screen in Figure 1 displays a list of saved courses, which is currently empty. 
To create a course, the instructor presses the <tt>Create new course</tt> button at the bottom of the window,
whereupon the system displays the window shown in Figure 2.

The course name is a short string for what the instructor wishes to call the course. Each
course section contains a chapter, which is a decimal corresponding to a textbook section. The name
is a string corresponding to the name of that section.
<p>
The instructor selects each textbox and fills in the appropriate information for their course's sections. To add
another section, the instructor hits the <tt>Create new section</tt> button, whereupon the system responds by adding another
textbox for a chapter and name under the <tt>Course Sections</tt> list. A filled-out view of a course is displayed in Figure 3.

When the instructor selects a section and presses the <tt>Remove section</tt> button,
the system responds by removing the section from the <tt>Course Sections</tt> list.
<p>
To the right of the section names are edit buttons. When the instructor presses the <tt>edit</tt> button,
the window shown in Figure 4 appears.

<p>
The table in the center of the window labeled <tt>Question Types</tt> represents the types of questions
that are present in this section. Each individual question type will have a list of questions
that can be on the test. The <tt>Description</tt> is a string that represents the name for the type of question. 
The <tt>Count</tt> label in the tabel represents the number of questions that are stored for that question type.
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Add new question</tt> button, the system responds by adding a new question
type to the <tt>Question Types</tt> list.
<p>
When the instructor selects a question type and presses <tt>Remove question</tt>, the system responds by
removing that question type and its associated questions from the section.
<p>
When the instructor selects the <tt>Edit</tt> button next to a question type, the system responds by 
displaying the window shown in Figure 5.

<p>
The instructor can fill in the name of the question type in the textbox labeled <tt>Name</tt>. The
<tt>Question Bank</tt> shows the questions that are a part of this question type, with a checkbox
on the left for the instructor to choose if they want that question included in the question type. The <tt>Type</tt>
field shows the type of question, and the <tt>Last Used</tt> is a date representing when that question was last
used in a test.
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Add new question</tt> button, the system responds by adding a question
to the <tt>Question Bank</tt>. Similarly, when the instructor presses the <tt>Remove question</tt> button,
the system responds by removing that question from the bank. When the edit button to the right of a question is
pressed, the system responds by taking you to the question creation window, which is detailed in <b>Section 4.</b>
<p>
When the instructor has added all their desired questions to this question type, they can press the
<tt>Save question type</tt> button to save their changes and bring them back to the <tt>Section Editor</tt> screen.

As shown in Figure 6, the <tt>Section Editor</tt> screen now shows the number of questions the instructor
added to that question type under the <tt>Count</tt> field.
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Save section</tt> button, the system responds by saving their changes
to this section and returns to the <tt>Courses</tt> window, as shown in Figure 7.

<p>
The <tt>Last Modified</tt> field in the <tt>Courses</tt> list shows when the instructor last modified that course.
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Delete course</tt> button, the system displays the window shown in Figure 8.

<br>
The instructor is prompted to ensure they wish to remove the course. If the instructor presses <tt>No</tt> 
or hits the X at the top right of the screen, the system takes them back to the <tt>Courses</tt> view. 
If the instructor hits <tt>Yes</tt>, the system removes the course.
<p>
If the instructor hits the <tt>Edit course</tt> button, the window shown in Figure 3 is displayed again for the
instructor to make changes.
