2.3.  Creating a Course
</h3>
</a>
<p>
This scenario shows an individual instructor creating a new course, which serves as
a collection of question types for the instructor to select from when creating a test.
We assume that the instructor is using the Test Tool from scratch besides creating an account
and logging in, which is detailed in Section 1.

The initial Courses screen in Figure 1 displays a list of saved courses, which is currently empty. 
To create a course, the instructor presses the <tt>Create new course</tt> button at the bottom of the window,
whereupon the system displays the window shown in Figure 2.

The course name is a short string for what the instructor wishes to call the course. Each
course section contains a chapter, which is a decimal corresponding to a textbook section. The name
is a string corresponding to the name of that section.
<p>
The instructor selects each textbox and fills in the appropriate information for their course's sections. To add
another section, the instructor hits the <tt>Create new section</tt> button, whereupon the system responds by adding another
textbox for a chapter and name under the <tt>Course Sections</tt> list. A filled-out view of a course is displayed in Figure 3.

When the instructor selects a section and presses the <tt>Remove section</tt> button,
the system responds by removing the section from the <tt>Course Sections</tt> list.
<p>
To the right of the section names are edit buttons. When the instructor presses the <tt>edit</tt> button,
the Section Creation window appears, as shown in Figure 4 of the next section. For now, we assume that the instructor
finished creating the course, which looks like the window shown in Figure 7.

The <tt>Last Modified</tt> field in the <tt>Courses</tt> list shows when the instructor last modified that course.
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Delete course</tt> button, the system displays the window shown in Figure 8.

The instructor is prompted to ensure they wish to remove the course. If the instructor presses <tt>No</tt> 
or hits the X at the top right of the screen, the system takes them back to the <tt>Courses</tt> view. 
If the instructor hits <tt>Yes</tt>, the system removes the course.
<p>
If the instructor hits the <tt>Edit course</tt> button, the window shown in Figure 3 is displayed again for the
instructor to make changes.
