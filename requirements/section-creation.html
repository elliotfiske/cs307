2.3.1  Editing a Section
</h3>
</a>
<p> This scenario shows an instructor editing a section within a course, which contains
the types of questions that can be on a test for this course. After coming from the last section detailing
how to create a course, we assume that the instructor is editing a new section, as displayed in Figure 4.

<p>
The table in the center of the window labeled <tt>Question Types</tt> represents the types of questions
that are present in this section. Each individual question type will have a list of questions
that can be on the test. The <tt>Description</tt> is a string that represents the name for the type of question. 
The <tt>Count</tt> label in the tabel represents the number of questions that are stored for that question type.
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Add new question</tt> button, the system responds by adding a new question
type to the <tt>Question Types</tt> list.
<p>
When the instructor selects a question type and presses <tt>Remove question</tt>, the system responds by
removing that question type and its associated questions from the section.
<p>
When the instructor selects the <tt>Edit</tt> button next to a question type, the system responds by 
displaying the question type editor, which will be detailed in the next section.

We assume that the instructor has followed the next section to populate the <tt>Question Type</tt> and has returned from
that section. As shown in Figure 6, the <tt>Section Editor</tt> screen now shows the number of questions the instructor
added to that question type under the <tt>Count</tt> field.
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Save section</tt> button, the system responds by saving their changes
to this section and returns to the <tt>Courses</tt> view from the previous section.
