<p>
To create a short answer question, the user opens the question creator dialog, and then changes the question type to Short Answer. 
The user will see Figure 8.

For a short answer type question, the user adds the answers that he wants to be considered correct. The user does this by entering 
the answer in the '<tt>Enter an accepted answer...</tt>' input box. The user selects the '<tt>+</tt>' icon to add it to the list 
below the input box.
<p>
An example of a typical short answer question is shown in Figure 9.

If the user wants to remove all current answers to the question, he selects the '<tt>Remove all</tt>' button.
<p>
When the user selects an item on the list of answers, that answer is highlighted and more options are available. This is shown in 
Figure 10.
