2.3.2  Editing a Question Type
</h3>
</a>
<p>
In this scenario, we assume an instructor is editing a question type for a section they have already created. The system displays
the initial view of a question type shown in Figure X.

</a>
<br>
<p>
The instructor can fill in the name of the question type in the textbox labeled <tt>Name</tt>. 
<p>The <tt>Question Bank</tt> shows the questions that are a part of this question type, with a checkbox
on the left for the instructor to choose if they want that question included in the question type. 
<p>The <tt>Type</tt>
field shows the type of question, and the <tt>Last Used</tt> is a date representing when that question was last
used in a test.
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Add new question</tt> button, the system responds by adding a question
to the <tt>Question Bank</tt>. The system updates the window as shown in Figure X.

<hr>
</a>
<br>
<p>
When the instructor presses the <tt>Remove question</tt> button,
the system responds by removing that question from the bank. 
<p> The checkbox to the left of a question indicates whether the instructor wants that question to be a part of a test generated using this question type.
Checked off means the question will be ignored when generating tests.
<p>
<p>When the edit button to the right of a question is
pressed, the system responds by taking you to the question creation window, which is detailed in <b>Section 2.4</b>.
<p>
We assume the instructor has created questions for this question type, following the section mentioned above. Figure X shows a filled out Question Type.

When the instructor has added all their desired questions to this question type, they can press the
<tt>Save question type</tt> button to save their changes and bring them back to the <tt>Section Editor</tt> screen.
