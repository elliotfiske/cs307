This document defines requirements for an electronic Testing Tool. The tool provides functions to manage test questions as well as generate and administer tests to a class of students. Teachers can use the Testing Tool to store banks of questions and generate tests that pull from these banks, as well as create new questions for future tests. These tests can either be printed out for an "analog" test, or administered digitally to students through an online interface.
<br>
<br>
In addition to being extremely useful, the Testing Tool serves as a prime example of software engineering concepts and principles. The software development principles and processes used for the Testing Tool are considered part of the Testing Tool package as a whole.
