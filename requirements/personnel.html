1.2.  System Personnel
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The personnel involved in the Test Tool project are organized into the
following groups and subgroups:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
end users
<ol type=i>
<p> <li>
test-creation users
<p> <li>
proctoring users
<p> <li>
test-taking users
</ol>
<p> <li>
customers
<p> <li>
system developers
<p> <li>
computer science / software engineering students
<p> <li>
outside parties
</ol>
<p>
End users are those who use the Test Tool for its intended purpose. Test-creators add questions and use test generation to create online tests for proctors to administer to test-takers.
<p>
The primary customer is Gene Fisher.  He is customer representative for his
faculty and staff colleagues in the Computer Science department at the
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.  In this
representative capacity, Fisher will consult with other potential customers to
gather requirements from them, and integrate their requirements with his own.
<p>
The primary system developer is also Gene Fisher. His development activities are all those of the software development process, from requirements analysis through product implementation and deployment. He will also conduct the ongoing process activities of testing, configuration, documentation, and project management. The students tasked with developing this software as a particular iteration of a class projects are Andrew Adriance, Cody Rhodas, Dave Bolansky, Elliot Fiske, Max Linsenvard, and Gideon Wong. This team also serves as a group of domain experts who are familiar with test-taking, especially within computer-related classes.
