2.5  Student Directory
</h3>
</a>

This section covers the Student Directory.  It covers how to view a students information
and how to edit test information of the students.

</p><p>
Initially the Student Directory will show a list of students with greyed out
text telling the instructor to select a student.  The scrollable grid view to the left
contains a list of students showing their class, name, and grade based on current tests.
See Figure 24 for visual details.

<br>

To select a student the instructor left clicks with a mouse. Upon selecting a student the
 software will present the instructor with new information (Figure 25).  
<p>
In the middle of the screen a new list.  It contains a list of tests that the student
 has taken.  The left side of the list contains the test name, the right contains
 the grade.  The first result in the list will be automatically selected.
</p><p>
The far right contains the relevant information about the student and their test.
 The very top contains the students name with a picture of the student underneath.
 Underneath the student's picture is the name of the currently selected test followed
 by the students grade and score on the test.

Once the instructor left clicks the comment button in Figure 25 the software presents the 
test comment view.
</p><p>

The far left shows similar information to the right side of Figure 25.  However in addition
there is a Done and Cancel button.  Both return the instructor to the screen on figure 2 once
left clicked.  The difference being the done button will save comments,
 cancel will not save changes.  The edit button up top shift the instructor into edit mode 
 once left clicked (see next section).  
 </p><p>
 
 The red X next to the edit button indicates wether
 the student got the question right.  The red X would be a green check if the instructor got 
 the question right.
 </p><p>
 
The previous and next button at the bottom of the screen will navigate
 the instructor backwards and forwards in the questions respectively.   The white field next
 to the comment tag allows the instructor to enter a text comment once left clicked.   The 
 middle right area contains the test question and the students answer.

The instructor selects edit (from either the comment section or main student test view) and is
brought to Figure 27.  This screen presents much the same information as Figure 26.  However
their are two main differences. The bottom comment section is instead two buttons.
Mark as correct and Mark as wrong respectively change the correctness of the question
when selected.  The score value on the left is then correctly updated.  The Edit button
at the top is replaced with a Comment button.  Selecting the comment button brings up the
comment menu again (Figure 26).
</p><p>

The top also contains a new text field for Extra Points.  The default value is a greyed out
zero.  The instructor then left clicks on the text field to enter a point value to adjust
a students score.
