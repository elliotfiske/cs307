<h4>
1.5.5 TestMoz
</h4>
</a>
<p>
TestMoz is a relatively popular test-making tool. It provides the absolute basics for test creation 
and prides itself on its simplicity.  Users take the test through their Internet browser without any 
registration, and both the user and administrator can see the results as soon as the user is finished. 
However, its simplicity is also a flaw: customizability is low, and there is no true user identification.
<p>
TestMoz lacks many features that provide depth to the test creation process; yet, 
if the test in question does not need such complexity, this tool functions extremely well.
<p>
