1.4.  Impacts
</h3>

<p>
<font> <p>The potential positive impacts of Test Tool mark an increase in efficiency
 and connivence for both test takers and makers.  For test makers the process of reusing old
 test questions becomes very simple and thus decreases the amount of time spent making a test.
 Additionally the automatic grading features benefit both parties by allowing test takers to
 know their results much faster than a traditional test, and saves test makers time in the grader
 process.  Test takers coding questions will be more natural as writing code with pen an paper can
 often be unnatural.</p>

<p>The potential negative impacts include issues of learning a new system, and not having
 as much oversight in the test creation process.  For test makers, while they may edit every
  question as they see fit on a test, with a system that automatically generates tests it
   makes it much easier for old test questions that are no longer relevant slip by.
     Additionally if the tool is not intuitive it may actually be slower than a test maker 
     using the system they are already familiar with.  For test takers the shift to a computer
      based exam may set them at a disadvantage after years of taking tests on paper the
       transition might be unnatural at first. </p></font>
