Today we reviewed our initial drawings that we made for our user interface requirements. We shared our drawings on a site called moqups and commented on what functionality we needed to include, as well as style choices. We showed our customer our draft images and were told to keep moving forward with our ideas! We planned to finish our writeups of our scenarios by our next meeting.
