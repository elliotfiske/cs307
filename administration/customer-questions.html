  <tr>
  	<td valign=top>2
  	<td valign=top>What type of anti-cheat measures do you want?
  	<td valign=top>While this hasn't been thought about, having various test versions is a good idea.
  <tr>
  	<td valign=top>3
  	<td valign=top>Does it need to be able to compile code, and if so, which languages?

  <tr>
  	<td valign=top>4
  	<td valign=top>How do you want grade info exported?
  	<td valign=top>No preference. Likely needs to be in-app.
  <tr>

  	<td valign=top>Do you want users to be able to give feedback on the questions/answers?
  	<td valign=top>Up to us.
  <tr>
  	<td valign=top>12
  	<td valign=top>Should it support multiple tries?
  	<td valign=top>It would be a good idea.
